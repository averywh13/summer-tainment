        <h5 class="card-title text-white" >MY EXPERIENCE</h5>
        <p class="card-text text-white" style="height: 250px;">On September 17, 2023, Colts Neck hosted a polo game at the Bucksmill Park in Colts Neck, New Jersey. People set up tailgaits and have a tailgait competition and a hat competion. Out tent theme was "Arabian Nights" and my mom and her friend entered the hat contest with a "Champagne Wishes and Caviar Dreams" hat theme. Everyone who passed by called our tent "the best
          and "most decorated," however we only won the hat competition. Earlier, the polo game started and we had two teams, Delicious Orchards team versus a Huddy's Inn team, and the Delicious Orchards team ended up winning. Polo consists of four players on each team and 6 chukkers. A chukker is seven and half minutes and there are three chukkers in the first half, a 15 minute half-time, and another three chukkers afterwards. After each chukker is over, players return to their trailers and have three minutes to get on their next horse for the next chukker. During the game, we have a small half time show which includes a parade of horses of different backstories, breeds, and colors. There is a tradition in polo where members of the audience will go out and stomp the divits made from the polo mallets the riders use when hitting the ball. My horse, Jersey, and I were suppose to be in the parade, however, this year the committee decided to have someone lead and American flag out on horse-back. My horse was already anxious because of the loud noises and fast commotion going on, which ended up in him freaking out. He was refusing to walk forward and backed up into other horses and other people. I eventually hopped off and walked him back to our barn.  </h2>

        <h5 class="card-title text-white" >HISTORY</h5>
        <p class="card-text text-white" style="height: 50px;">The history of horse polo dates back over 2000 years. It has evolved over time and can be traced to numerous origins.</p>
<ol>
<li>Origins in Persia:</li>
<ul>
<li>Polo is often believed to have originated in ancient Persia, around the 6th century BCE. The Persians called it "chogan" or "sagol kud," and it was initially played by the nobility and military as a training exercise for cavalry units.</li>
<li>The game was initially played with a wooden ball and riders used sticks with a hook to hit the ball.</li>
</ul>
<li>Spread to Central Asia and India:</li>
<ul>
<li>Polo gradually spread to other parts of Central Asia, including modern-day Afghanistan, and from there to the Indian subcontinent. In India, it became a popular sport among royalty and the elite during the Mughal Empire (16th to 18th centuries).</li>
</ul>
<li>British Influence:</li>
<ul>
<li>The British Empire played a significant role in popularizing and standardizing the game of polo. British officers stationed in India in the 19th century adopted and adapted the sport.</li>
<li>The first polo club, known as the Silchar Polo Club, was established in Assam, India, in 1834. The game quickly gained popularity among the British military and civilian communities.</li>
</ul>
<li>Spread to the West:</li>
<ul>
<li>Polo was introduced to the Western world in the late 19th century, primarily through British and American enthusiasts.</li>
<li>The sport gained a following in England and the United States, where it became known as "polo" instead of "chogan."</li>
</ul>
<li>Formal Rules and Organization:</li>
<ul>
<li>The first set of formal rules for polo, known as the Hurlingham Rules, was established in England in 1874. These rules standardized the game and made it more competitive.</li>
<li>The Hurlingham Polo Association, founded in 1876, helped organize and promote the sport in England.</li>
</ul>
<li>Modern Polo</li>
<ul>
<li>Polo has continued to evolve and is now played professionally in many countries around the world.</li>
<li>International competitions, such as the Copa de las Naciones and the Polo World Cup, showcase the highest levels of the sport.</li>
<li>Polo has also become popular as a spectator sport, with events like the U.S. Open Polo Championship drawing large crowds.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
